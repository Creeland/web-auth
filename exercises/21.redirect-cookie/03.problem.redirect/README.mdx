# Redirect

üë®‚Äçüíº It's the moment we've all been waiting for! In this step we're going to do
three basic things
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" />:

1. Read the `redirectTo` value from the `request` using the
   `getRedirectCookieValue` utility
1. Safely redirect the user to `redirectTo` wherever we're redirecting the user.
1. Destroy the `redirectTo` cookie with the `destroyRedirectToHeader`

The tricky bit here is we've got a couple places where we redirect the user, so
we'll need to handle all of those. In some cases we'll even need to include a
`redirectTo` query param to forward the `redirectTo` logic to the next step.

Here's how you test this out:

1. Be logged out
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />
1. You'll be redirected to `/login`
1. Click "Login with GitHub"
1. You should be redirected to `/settings/profile` and logged in

Good luck!
